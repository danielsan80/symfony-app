My Symfony App
========================

This repo is a Symfony (2.1) App. It is not to install, I use it to have several **snapshots**
of a generic Symfony application in several **building phases**.

Each branch is one of this phases. The branch master keep only this README.md to explane each branch.

The idea is to mantain my own repository and fork from a specific snapshot to start with a new application.

If this idea works, my proposal is to make your own repository with your set of snapshots. Else you can fork one of mine.

If you see a mistake in this text I will gratefull if you could correct it an make me a pull request so I can **improve my written english** too.

It's a simple hello world application. One route (/) that write "Hello World!".

To install Symfony I followed this link:

Then I did some basic and helpfull thinks:

* The Acme Demo Bundle is removed
* A Main Bundle is created
* ...
